# Cipher

Cipher is a command-line coding assistant powered by Google Gemini, designed to help you interact with and manage Python projects.

---

## Why Cipher?

Cipher was created to simplify working with Python projects from the command line. It helps automate repetitive tasks, provides quick access to project information, and assists with code management, all without leaving your terminal.

---

## Motivation

Managing and navigating codebases can be time-consuming, especially when switching between tools. Cipher aims to keep everything in one place, making it easier to focus on development and problem-solving.
